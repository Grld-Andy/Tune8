Nobody's gon drain my energy
I will never stop
I'm motivated by enemies
Setting up shop

Going through life regretfully
I'd rather work non stop
What they call incessantly
Than work some odd job
Just to live life pleasantly

And they're filled with objection
Too filled for recollection
So we're losing all attention

'Cause I'm gaining their attention
'Cause I'm making a connection
Lyricism and aggression
Got me feeling my ascension
In my passion my profession
I'm attacking my obsession
Taking action and progressing ah

That's what makes them scared of me
Make my plans carefully
Then execute them daringly
They say I act recklessly
But that's why im effective see
You can't predict my tendencies

Others think I'll be a legend
And I'm never gunna stop

But my mind stay present
Don't let your dreams stop
'Cause dreaming is a blessing
Yea they doubt me all the same
